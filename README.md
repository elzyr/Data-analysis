## üìñ Project Description

This project explores and predicts student outcomes by analyzing a rich dataset containing academic, demographic, and socio-economic features. The primary goal is to classify students into one of three categories at the end of the normal course duration:
- **Dropout**  
- **Enrollment/Continued Studies**  
- **Graduation**

The complete analysis pipeline includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and applying machine learning algorithms (such as Random Forest and SVM) for predictive modeling.
